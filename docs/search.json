    "text": "1 Introduction\nAs new students in NYC, we are constantly exposed to crime-related updates through Clery Crime Alerts from Columbia University, which emphasize the importance of staying informed about local safety concerns. Additionally, Columbia’s initiatives, such as self-defense classes and situational awareness events, highlight the need to understand crime dynamics in our community. Beyond personal safety, this topic provides us an opportunity to examine broader societal concerns, including the effectiveness of public safety policies and the equity of law enforcement. This motivated us to explore NYC’s arrest data to gain deeper insights about the trend and distributions across the city.\nOur primary focus is to analyze and highlight the crime frequency distribution across precincts in NYC from January to September 2024, as understanding these geographical patterns is crucial for identifying areas with higher or lower crime rates. Additionally, we aim to uncover temporal trends in arrests, such as fluctuations by month or time of day, to better understand when crimes are more likely to occur. Furthermore, we seek to identify the most prevalent types of crimes and examine how these vary across demographic groups, including age, sex, and race, to provide a comprehensive view of NYC’s crime dynamics.\n\n\n2 first version\nThis dataset captures detailed information about arrests, including crime types, locations, times, and perpetrator demographics. By analyzing this data, we aim to investigate and visualize several key questions:\n\nWhat are the overall crime patterns in NYC from January to September 2024?\nHow are crimes distributed across police boroughs, precincts, and demographic categories such as age, sex, and race?\nAre there discernible temporal trends in arrests, such as variations by month or time of day?\nWhat are the most common types of crimes, and how do these vary geographically and demographically?",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data source for this project is the “NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date)” dataset, available through NYC OpenData. This data is collected by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and is reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning. Each record represents an arrest made in NYC by the NYPD, including details such as the type of crime, location, time of enforcement, and perpetrator’s demographics.\nThe data is in tabular format, consisting of 19 columns and approximately 195,000 rows, and is manually updated every quarter, with the data format including both numerical and text categorical fields. The available attachment, “NYPD_Arrest_YTD_DataDictionary.xlsx,” contains a detailed description of each variable.\nHowever, the dataset has several potential issues, including inconsistencies or delays due to manual updates, and outdated entries because of the quarterly update frequency. Null values are frequently present in certain fields, as some specific data were not collected or were unknown at the time of the report. Additionally, geo-location inaccuracies may affect spatial analysis since some arrests are represented by approximate coordinates.\nThe dataset is available in CSV format on the NYC OpenData portal, which can be directly exported, downloaded locally, and imported into RStudio using the read.csv() function. ## Missing value analysis\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(naniar)\nCode\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"NYPD_Arrest_Data.csv\", na.strings = c(\"(null)\", \"N/A\"))\nmissing_summary &lt;- data |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Column\", values_to = \"Missing_Values\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Missing_Values)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Column = factor(Column, levels = Column)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Proportion = Missing_Values / nrow(data)) \n  \nggplot(missing_summary, aes(x = Column, y = Missing_Values)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Values by Column\", x = \"Columns\", y = \"Number of Missing Values\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Number of Missing Values\",\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / nrow(data) * 100, name = \"Proportion of Missing Values (%)\")\n  )\nCode\ndata_with_na &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(if_any(everything(), is.na))\n\nboro_na_summary &lt;- data_with_na |&gt;\n  group_by(ARREST_BORO) |&gt;\n  summarise(Missing_Count = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Missing_Count)) |&gt;\n  mutate(ARREST_BORO = case_when(\n    ARREST_BORO == \"B\" ~ \"Bronx\",\n    ARREST_BORO == \"S\" ~ \"Staten Island\",\n    ARREST_BORO == \"K\" ~ \"Brooklyn\",\n    ARREST_BORO == \"M\" ~ \"Manhattan\",\n    ARREST_BORO == \"Q\" ~ \"Queens\"\n  )) |&gt;\n  mutate(ARREST_BORO = factor(ARREST_BORO, levels = ARREST_BORO))\n  \nggplot(boro_na_summary, aes(x = ARREST_BORO, y = Missing_Count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Data by Borough\", x = \"Arrest Borough\", y = \"Count of Missing Rows\") +\n  theme_minimal()\nCode\nvis_miss(data_with_na) +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Data\", x = \"Columns\", y = \"Rows\")",
