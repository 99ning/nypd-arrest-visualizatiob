# Conclusion

This exploration provided critical insights into arrest patterns in NYC, highlighting borough-wise distributions, racial demographics, and temporal trends. In particular, offense levels remain consistent across all boroughs, with misdemeanors and felonies accounting for the majority of arrests. Black individuals dominate the arrest counts, with the 25-44 age group being the most represented demographic. Temporal trends revealed that weekdays, especially Tuesday and Wednesday, experience the highest arrest counts, while weekends show significantly lower activity. Brooklyn stands out with the highest daily arrests, while Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens exhibit similar medians. Staten Island consistently reports the lowest arrests. These findings highlight both the spatial and temporal disparities in arrest patterns across NYC.

However, the nine-month data scope limits broader applicability, particularly for assessing yearly trends. Expanding the dataset to cover longer year period could validate the observed weekly patterns and discover potential seasonal effects and yearly cycles, providing a more robust analysis. Future work could include an interactive dashboard linking temporal trends with demographic distributions, enabling users to explore racial proportions across precincts and limit visualizations to specific time ranges. Examining underlying causes for temporal variations, such as societal or policing factors, could offer deeper context and actionable insights. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in generating diverse visualizations using R and interactive plots with D3, while systematically exploring datasets to address real-world problems. Importantly, we recognized that data analysis may not always align with initial expectations; in such cases, itâ€™s important to document the discoveries and pivot to investigate alternative perspectives of the data.
