# Conclusion

This exploration provided critical insights into arrest patterns in NYC, highlighting borough-wise distributions, racial demographics, and temporal trends. In particular, Brooklyn consistently having the highest arrest counts and Black individuals dominating arrests across most boroughs. Temporal trends highlighted midweek peaks in arrests and lower activity on weekends, suggesting distinct weekly cycles in law enforcement activity. However, the nine-month data scope limits broader applicability, particularly for assessing yearly trends. Expanding the dataset to cover five years could validate the observed weekly patterns and uncover potential seasonal effects and yearly cycles, providing a more robust analysis. Future work could include an interactive dashboard linking temporal trends with demographic distributions, enabling users to explore racial proportions across precincts and limit visualizations to specific time ranges. Examining underlying causes for temporal variations, such as societal or policing factors, could offer deeper context and actionable insights. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in generating diverse visualizations using R and interactive plots with D3, while systematically exploring datasets to address real-world problems. Importantly, we recognized that data analysis may not always align with initial expectations; in such cases, itâ€™s important to document the discoveries and pivot to investigate alternative perspectives of the data.
